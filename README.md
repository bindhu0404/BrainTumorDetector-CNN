# BrainTumorDetector-CNN
A deep learning-based CNN model for brain tumor detection using MRI images. Built with TensorFlow and Keras, this model classifies MRI scans as either "Brain Tumor" or "Healthy" with high accuracy.

Features:
-Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for precise classification
-Data Augmentation to enhance dataset size (1000+ images)
-Trained on MRI scans for real-world applicability
-High accuracy achieved through deep learning optimization

Enabling early detection of brain tumors with advanced AI technology!
